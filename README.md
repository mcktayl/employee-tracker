# Employee Tracker

## Description

This application is meant to help employers manage a simple and effective database of the employees, roles, and departments in their company. This project gave me an opportunity to practice working with Node.js, MySQL, and several packages from NPM to help manage, retrieve, and display that data.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Installation

This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and several NPM packages. Once Node has been installed on the user's machine, they can run "npm i" from their command terminal to install the necessary packages. There is a schema file that the user must input into their MySQL database in order to create and structure the database. Upon completion, the user may run "node server.js" to initiate the application.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
`md ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png) `

## Credits

I completed this project by myself, however I did watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeOJ0ZMUYw&t=559s) tutorial from Socratica to learn more about MySQL joins.
